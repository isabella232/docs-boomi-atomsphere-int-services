##<a id='using'></a> Using Boomi AtomSphere Integration Services for PCF

### General Usage

Since the Boomi Atom is mostly controlled via the AtomSphere platform, there is very little which needs to be done
from within PCF.  There are a few tasks which may need to be done directly in PCF from time to time:

#### Starting and stopping the Boomi Atom service (and/or the hosting virtual machines)

The Atoms can be controlled as normal Bosh services.

#### Accessing files on the Atom's filesystem

Occassionally, files may need to be accessed or modified directly on the Atom's local filesystem.  In order to get to this location, use the following steps:

1. Find the Atom's local directory from the [Startup Properties panel](http://help.boomi.com/atomsphere/GUID-390D5707-698A-4FB1-A0E2-6B236E3F4580.html) in the AtomSphere user interface under the entry named **Atom Installation Directory**.
1. Ssh to the appropriate virtual machine using the standard Bosh procedures.
1. Use the information from the first step to 'cd' into the Atom's installation directory.

#### Resizing the Virtual Machine hosting the Atom

Return to the **Resource Config** tab in the tile configuration page.  Choose the new configuration parameters as
appropriate and **Apply changes**.  Note that the Atom will be restarted as the underlying virtual machine is
re-sized, but no information should be lost.
